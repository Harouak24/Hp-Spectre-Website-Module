		Just when you think the HP Spectre x360 couldn’t possibly get any better, HP takes its premium line to a whole new level in 2020. This latest addition to line brings in key updates and new features while bringing back all those features we already know and love about the line.

        Now, the HP Spectre x360 is not only more powerful and feature-rich than ever, but it also truly exemplifies the best qualities of both laptops and tablets, starting with the updates under the hood. Inside is an impressive brand-new processor, the Intel Core i7-1065G7, which is an absolute powerhouse of a chip, as well as the flashy new Iris Plus integrated graphics and a RAM that’s doubled. 

        With those specs, there’s no doubt that this laptop can contend with its big and bulky peers rocking discrete graphics cards. But, it also keeps everything breathtaking on the outside. While keeping everything thin and light, it now boasts a stunning 4K touch display for the lower-end configurations. This gives the more casual users of the line the option to have that glorious 4K viewing that only its higher-end configuration owners have enjoyed before.

        With its cutting-edge design and features, the HP Spectre x360 for 2020 has never really been your everyday office grinder. But, in 2020, this stunning piece of portable is something new, something sexier.
